Rating sets are collections of ratings with the same `RatingSpecification <RatingSpecification.html>`_ ID. A rating set may have one or more ratings, each with its own effective time, and can
be thought of as an irregluar time series of ratings.

Ratings (and thus rating sets) may have one or more independent parameters and one dependent parameter. Reverse rating is possible only with ratings with a single independent parameter.
